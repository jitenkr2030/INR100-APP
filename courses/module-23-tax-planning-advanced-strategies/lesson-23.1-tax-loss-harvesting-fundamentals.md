## Tax-Loss Harvesting Fundamentals

### What is Tax-Loss Harvesting?
Tax-loss harvesting is an investment strategy that involves selling securities at a loss to offset capital gains taxes on profitable investments. It's a powerful technique for reducing tax liability while maintaining investment exposure.

### Core Principles
- **Offset Gains**: Use capital losses to offset capital gains
- **Tax Savings**: Reduce current year tax liability
- **Market Neutral**: Maintain market exposure through replacements
- **Systematic**: Can be done systematically throughout year
- **Long-term**: Best for long-term wealth building

### Basic Mechanics
- **Identify Losses**: Find investments with unrealized losses
- **Sell Positions**: Sell losing positions before year-end
- **Offset Gains**: Use losses to offset capital gains
- **Replace Holdings**: Maintain exposure with similar investments
- **Carry Forward**: Save excess losses for future years

## Capital Gains and Losses

### Capital Gains Taxation

#### Short-term Capital Gains
- **Holding Period**: Assets held for 1 year or less
- **Tax Rate**: Taxed as ordinary income
- **Higher Rate**: Higher tax rates for most taxpayers
- **Timing**: Short-term gains timing is crucial
- **Planning**: Consider timing of short-term gains

#### Long-term Capital Gains
- **Holding Period**: Assets held for more than 1 year
- **Tax Rates**: Preferential tax rates (0%, 15%, 20%)
- **Lower Rate**: Significantly lower than ordinary income
- **Planning**: Hold investments for long-term tax benefits
- **Benefits**: Substantial tax savings for long-term holdings

### Capital Losses Utilization

#### Loss Offset Rules
- **Capital Gains**: Offset against capital gains first
- **Ordinary Income**: Up to $3,000 of excess losses annually
- **Carryforward**: Remaining losses carry forward indefinitely
- **No Limit**: No limit on capital loss carryforwards
- **Permanent**: Losses can offset gains in future years

#### Loss Limitations
- **Wash Sale**: Cannot repurchase substantially identical security
- **Timing**: Must sell in same tax year as gains
- **Documentation**: Proper record keeping required
- **Substance**: Must be legitimate investment decisions
- **Voluntary**: Must be voluntary sale, not forced

## Wash Sale Rules

### Wash Sale Definition
A wash sale occurs when you sell a security at a loss and then buy a substantially identical security within 30 days before or after the sale. The loss is disallowed and added to the basis of the replacement security.

### Key Wash Sale Rules

#### 30-Day Window
- **Before**: Purchases within 30 days before sale
- **After**: Purchases within 30 days after sale
- **Same Day**: Same-day purchases count
- **Multiple**: Multiple transactions within window
- **Automatic**: Rules apply automatically, no intent required

#### Substantially Identical
- **Same Security**: Same exact security
- **Similar Exposure**: Substantially similar exposure
- **Mutual Funds**: Same mutual fund or similar fund
- **ETFs**: Same ETF or similar ETF
- **Stocks**: Same stock or essentially same stock

#### Partial Wash Sales
- **Pro-Rata**: Loss disallowed on pro-rata basis
- **Replacement**: Basis adjustment on replacement securities
- **Multiple**: Multiple purchases within wash sale period
- **Calculation**: Complex pro-rata calculations
- **Documentation**: Detailed record keeping required

### Wash Sale Examples

#### Basic Wash Sale
- **Buy**: Buy 100 shares of ABC at $100
- **Price Drops**: Price drops to $80
- **Sell**: Sell at $80 for $2,000 loss
- **Repurchase**: Repurchase 100 shares within 30 days
- **Result**: $2,000 loss added to basis of new shares

#### Partial Wash Sale
- **Buy**: Buy 100 shares at $100, 50 shares at $110
- **Sell**: Sell 100 shares at $80
- **Repurchase**: Repurchase 25 shares within 30 days
- **Calculation**: 25/100 = 25% wash sale
- **Adjustment**: $500 loss added to basis of 25 shares

#### Multiple Purchases
- **Buy**: Buy 100 shares at $100, then 100 shares at $90
- **Sell**: Sell 150 shares at $80
- **Wash Sale**: All purchases within 30 days count
- **Result**: Complex basis adjustment calculations
