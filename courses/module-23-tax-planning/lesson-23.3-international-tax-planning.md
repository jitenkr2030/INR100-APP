## Introduction

In an increasingly globalized world, many Indians have international income sources, foreign investments, or work abroad. Understanding international tax planning is crucial to optimize your tax liability while remaining compliant with both Indian and foreign tax laws.

## Understanding International Taxation Framework

### Indian Tax Residency Rules

**Resident vs Non-Resident:**
- **Resident**: If you stay in India for 182 days or more in a financial year
- **Non-Resident Indian (NRI)**: If you stay in India for less than 182 days in a financial year
- **Resident but Not Ordinarily Resident (RNOR)**: Special category with specific rules

**Tax Implications:**
- **Residents**: Taxed on global income (income earned anywhere in the world)
- **NRIs**: Taxed only on Indian income (income earned in India)

### Foreign Income Taxation

**For Indian Residents:**
- All foreign income is taxable in India
- Foreign taxes paid can be claimed as credit under Section 91
- Must report all foreign income in tax returns

**For NRIs:**
- Only Indian income is taxable
- Foreign income is not subject to Indian tax
- NRI status must be maintained each financial year

## Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs)

### What are DTAAs?

DTAAs are bilateral agreements between countries to avoid double taxation of the same income. India has DTAAs with over 85 countries including:
- United States
- United Kingdom
- Canada
- Australia
- Germany
- Singapore
- UAE
- Mauritius
- Netherlands

### Key Benefits of DTAAs:

1. **Tax Credit**: Avoid paying tax twice on the same income
2. **Reduced Withholding Tax**: Lower tax rates on dividends, interest, royalties
3. **Tax Exemption**: Some income may be exempt in one country
4. **Dispute Resolution**: Mechanism to resolve tax disputes

### Common DTAA Provisions:

**For Salaries:**
- Taxed in the country where services are rendered
- Exception: If you work less than 183 days in a country

**For Dividends:**
- Usually 10-15% withholding tax rate
- Subject to dividend distribution tax rules

**For Interest:**
- 10-15% withholding tax rate
- May be exempt if certain conditions are met

**For Royalties and Technical Fees:**
- 10-20% withholding tax rate
- Specific definitions in DTAA

## Tax Planning Strategies for International Income

### 1. Foreign Tax Credit Planning

**Understanding Section 91:**

### 2. Residency Planning

**Optimizing Tax Residency:**

### 3. Income Timing and Recognition

**Strategic Income Planning:**
- Defer income recognition to optimize tax years

**Example:**
