## Investment Strategy Framework

### Strategic vs Tactical Allocation

#### Strategic Allocation (80-90% of Crypto Portfolio)
- **Long-term Focus**: 2-5 year investment horizon
- **Core Holdings**: Established cryptocurrencies
- **Stable Proportions**: Relatively fixed allocation percentages
- **Rebalancing**: Quarterly or semi-annual adjustments
- **Examples**: 70% Bitcoin, 20% Ethereum, 10% other large caps

#### Tactical Allocation (10-20% of Crypto Portfolio)
- **Short-term Focus**: 3-12 month investment horizon
- **Opportunistic Investments**: Emerging trends and opportunities
- **Dynamic Proportions**: Flexible allocation based on market conditions
- **Active Management**: Monthly or quarterly rebalancing
- **Examples**: DeFi tokens, new protocols, altcoins

### Investment Philosophy Approaches

#### Bitcoin Maximalism
- **Focus**: Bitcoin as primary cryptocurrency investment
- **Rationale**: Bitcoin's network effect and store of value proposition
- **Portfolio**: 80-100% Bitcoin allocation
- **Strategy**: Long-term holding, ignore altcoins
- **Timeline**: 4+ year investment horizon

#### Crypto Diversification
- **Focus**: Multiple cryptocurrencies for diversification
- **Rationale**: Different use cases and growth potential
- **Portfolio**: Mix of established and emerging cryptocurrencies
- **Strategy**: Balanced approach with regular rebalancing
- **Timeline**: 2-3 year investment horizon

#### DeFi-Focused Strategy
- **Focus**: Decentralized Finance protocols and tokens
- **Rationale**: High growth potential of financial innovation
- **Portfolio**: High allocation to DeFi tokens
- **Strategy**: Active management, yield farming
- **Timeline**: 1-2 year investment horizon

#### Algorithmic/Systematic Approach
- **Focus**: Quantitative models and algorithmic strategies
- **Rationale**: Remove emotional bias from investment decisions
- **Portfolio**: Algorithm-driven allocation
- **Strategy**: Systematic rebalancing, risk parity
- **Timeline**: Continuous systematic approach

## Portfolio Construction Methods

### Equal Weight Portfolio
- **Method**: Equal allocation across selected cryptocurrencies
- **Pros**: Simple to implement, diversified exposure
- **Cons**: May overweight smaller projects
- **Best For**: Beginning investors, educational portfolios
- **Example**: 25% BTC, 25% ETH, 25% ADA, 25% SOL

### Market Cap Weighting
- **Method**: Allocate based on market capitalization
- **Pros**: Reflects market consensus, liquid investments
- **Cons**: May overweight overvalued assets
- **Best For**: Index-style investing, passive management
- **Example**: 60% BTC, 25% ETH, 8% BNB, 7% other

### Risk-Adjusted Weighting
- **Method**: Adjust allocation based on risk/volatility
- **Pros**: Better risk management, smoother returns
- **Cons**: More complex to implement
- **Best For**: Experienced investors, risk-conscious portfolios
- **Example**: 70% BTC, 20% ETH, 10% DeFi tokens

### Value-Based Weighting
- **Method**: Allocate based on fundamental value metrics
- **Pros**: Focuses on underlying value
- **Cons**: Requires extensive research
- **Best For**: Fundamental analysts, long-term investors
- **Example**: Evaluate on development activity, adoption, tokenomics

## Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) Strategies

### Traditional DCA
- **Method**: Fixed amount invested at regular intervals
- **Frequency**: Weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly
- **Amount**: Fixed dollar amount regardless of price
- **Timeline**: 12-24 month average-in period
- **Example**: $500 invested every month for 2 years

### Variable DCA
- **Method**: Adjust investment amount based on market conditions
- **Increase During Dips**: Invest more when prices are lower
- **Decrease During Peaks**: Invest less when prices are high
- **Formula**: Base amount × (Average price / Current price)
- **Example**: Base $500, if price drops 20%, invest $625

### Lump Sum with DCA Backup
- **Method**: Initial lump sum investment plus ongoing DCA
- **Initial Investment**: 60-70% of planned allocation
- **DCA Investment**: 30-40% over 6-12 months
- **Rationale**: Capture market exposure while averaging risk
- **Example**: $10,000 initial + $1,000 monthly for 10 months

### Salary-Scaling DCA
- **Method**: Percentage of income invested regularly
- **Percentage**: 5-15% of after-tax income
- **Frequency**: Monthly with salary
- **Adjustments**: Increase percentage over time
- **Example**: 10% of $5,000 monthly salary = $500/month

## Risk Management Techniques

### Position Sizing Rules

#### Fixed Percentage Rule
- **Maximum per Cryptocurrency**: 5-10% of total crypto portfolio
- **Total Crypto Allocation**: 5-15% of total investment portfolio
- **Rationale**: Limits concentration risk
- **Example**: $10,000 crypto portfolio, max $1,000 per cryptocurrency

#### Volatility-Based Sizing
- **Higher Volatility**: Smaller position sizes
- **Lower Volatility**: Larger position sizes
- **Calculation**: Position size = Risk budget / Volatility
- **Example**: BTC volatility 60%, allocate 2% of portfolio

#### Kelly Criterion Application
- **Formula**: f = (bp - q) / b
- **Where**: f = fraction to bet, b = odds, p = win probability, q = loss probability
- **Application**: Position sizing based on expected returns
- **Conservative Approach**: Use 25-50% of Kelly for safety

### Stop-Loss Strategies

#### Percentage Stop-Loss
- **Fixed Percentage**: 20-30% stop-loss on individual positions
- **Trailing Stops**: Adjust stop-loss as position moves favorably
- **Market Conditions**: Wider stops in volatile markets
- **Example**: Buy at $50,000, stop at $37,500 (25% stop)

#### Time-Based Stop-Loss
- **Maximum Hold Time**: Exit if thesis doesn't play out
- **Review Periods**: Monthly or quarterly thesis review
- **Exit Triggers**: Technology changes, regulatory risks
- **Example**: Hold maximum 2 years unless thesis changes

#### Fundamental Stop-Loss
- **Thesis-Based Exits**: Exit when investment thesis breaks
- **Technology Risks**: Protocol failures or security issues
- **Regulatory Changes**: Unfavorable regulatory developments
- **Competitive Threats**: New superior technologies emerge

### Portfolio-Level Risk Management

#### Correlation Management
- **Correlation Analysis**: Monitor correlation between holdings
- **Diversification Benefits**: Reduce portfolio volatility
- **Rebalancing**: Adjust when correlations change
- **Tools**: Correlation matrices, rolling correlations

#### Drawdown Management
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Limit portfolio decline
- **Volatility Targeting**: Adjust position sizes based on volatility
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Reduce risk during high volatility periods
- **Recovery Planning**: Strategy for rebuilding after losses

#### Liquidity Management
- **Exchange Liquidity**: Ensure adequate trading volume
- **Slippage Control**: Limit price impact of large orders
- **Emergency Liquidity**: Maintain cash reserves
- **Withdrawal Planning**: Consider withdrawal constraints

## Rebalancing Strategies

### Calendar-Based Rebalancing

#### Monthly Rebalancing
- **Frequency**: Rebalance every month
- **Advantages**: Consistent exposure, quick adjustments
- **Disadvantages**: Transaction costs, short-term focus
- **Best For**: Active traders, tactical allocation

#### Quarterly Rebalancing
- **Frequency**: Rebalance every 3 months
- **Advantages**: Balance between responsiveness and cost
- **Disadvantages**: May miss significant market moves
- **Best For**: Moderate active management

#### Annual Rebalancing
- **Frequency**: Rebalance once per year
- **Advantages**: Low transaction costs, long-term focus
- **Disadvantages**: May allow significant drift
- **Best For**: Long-term investors, passive management

### Threshold-Based Rebalancing

#### Percentage Deviation
- **Trigger**: Rebalance when allocation deviates by 5-10%
- **Dynamic**: Adjust thresholds based on volatility
- **Cost-Effective**: Rebalance only when necessary
- **Example**: Target 50% BTC, rebalance when it reaches 55-60%

#### Volatility-Adjusted Thresholds
- **High Volatility**: Wider rebalancing thresholds
- **Low Volatility**: Tighter rebalancing thresholds
- **Adaptive**: Thresholds adjust with market conditions
- **Example**: BTC threshold ±5% in normal times, ±10% in high volatility

### Opportunistic Rebalancing

#### Market Timing Rebalancing
- **Buy Dips**: Increase allocation during market corrections
- **Take Profits**: Reduce allocation during parabolic moves
- **Fundamental Rebalancing**: Adjust based on fundamental changes
- **Risk-On/Risk-Off**: Adjust based on market sentiment

#### Tax-Efficient Rebalancing
- **Tax-Loss Harvesting**: Realize losses to offset gains
- **Long-Term Holding**: Hold winners for tax benefits
- **Account Structure**: Use different accounts for tax efficiency
- **Timing**: Consider tax implications in rebalancing decisions

## Advanced Investment Strategies
